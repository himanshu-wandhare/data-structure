struct rectangle
{
    int length;
    int breadth;
};
int main()
{
    struct rectangle *r;
    r->length=34;       Accesing structure member using "Arrow Operator"
        OR
    (*r).length=34;         Accesing structure member using ". operator".
                            The precedency of "dot operator" is higher than "* operator" hence we use "bracket()"
                            to give fist precedency to *r.
