Q. Why we need poitners?
    1. To access the Heap memory
    2. To use the external files in the hardisk.
    3. To access resources of Monitor, keyboards ,etc (Hardware)
    4. Parameter Passing

Major role: Accessing the resources which are outside(external) the program


Q. How allocate memory in Heap?
int main()
{
    int *p;
    p=(int*)malloc(5*sizeof(int));         It will allocate memeory for 5 integer (It is also called as dynamic
                                           memory allocation)       C format

    p=new int[5];                          In C++ format
}
